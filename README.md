no real work experience but about 10 projects done ranging from c# to php and html

projects:

-1st project-code easy
this was my first introduction to c# we had to complete very simple tasks to learn about coding,
kind of like the standard "hello world" code you do.

-2nd project-calculator
this project we had to develop a simple calculator in c#
this was the first time we used visual studio 2019 so i had to get familiar with the interface etc
but after a while it became second nature.

-3rd project-programming tool
for this project we had to develop a programing tool that could show the user how a "for" and "while" loop worked.
the user could input different variables like the starting value or wether they wanted to use a for loop or a while loop
they could also decide the end value etc.

-4th project-sopranos
this 4th project had us switching over to php in visual studio code we also learned a bit about html and css.
the goal was to design a website for a pizza shop the user of this website was supposed to be able to place an order
or check the adres or even folow the progress of the order.

-5th project-steptember
this project was also php we had to make a website where people could see the results of a competition that lasted 1 week,
there were also 5 different teams and each day they had different scores
so you had to write the code in a way that the user could select the information he wanted to know
for example the average score of team 1 and 4 on tuesday and then it would be printed at the bottom.

6th project-tamagotchi
this project was about creating a tamagotchi game
basically you have a creature that loses health slowly and it stays alive if you water it and feed it if you dont it dies.
